/*
Notes on Interfaces:
Like abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to create objects (in the example above, it is not possible to create an "IAnimal" object in the Program class)
Interface methods do not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class
On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods
Interfaces can contain properties and methods, but not fields/variables
Interface members are by default abstract and public
An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)

/*
 * An interface is an entity that contains only abstract methods in them. 
 * The methods of the interface are always public. 
 * The Class that implements an interface must implement all the methods of the interface. They can however redeclare the method as abstract and make itself an Abstract class. The access specifier for the implemented methods must be public.
 * The idea of the interface is to enforce a rule to implement all the methods like a contract, the contract is the interface and enforcing is done by the implementor classes. 
 * Interfaces are the basis for most of the Software frameworks that are available in the computer software industry.
